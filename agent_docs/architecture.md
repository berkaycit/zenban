## Data Flow

1. `BoardStore` (@Observable) holds all state
2. `BoardStorage` handles JSON file I/O with debounced saves
3. Views read from `BoardStore` via `@Environment`
4. User actions call `BoardStore` methods which update state and trigger save

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `BoardStore` | Central state manager. Tracks focusRegion, devServerState FSM, gitChangesCardID. Creates/deletes worktrees. stopOverlays() cleans up on card/board delete. |
| `BoardStorage` | JSON persistence to Application Support |
| `Board/Card/Column` | Data models. Board has repositoryPath/agent. Card can override agent. Column has display name/color. |
| `TerminalManager` | Manages GhosttyTerminalView per card with LRU eviction (max 50). Hibernates on deselect. Auto-launches agent. |
| `TmuxSessionManager` | Actor managing tmux sessions (zenban- prefix). Sync cleanup on app quit, async on card delete. |
| `GhosttyTerminalView` | Terminal with state machine (shell/agentActive/agentIdle). OSC 133 for command detection. Ctrl+C exits agent. |
| `GhosttyApp` | Singleton for Ghostty context. Routes actions, handles clipboard, reloads config on settings change. |
| `GitService` | Git via libgit2: repo init, worktree CRUD, status/diff, commit/push, merge. PR via gh CLI. AI commit messages. |
| `ClaudeService` | Claude Code CLI integration implementing AIProvider protocol. |
| `DevServerManager` | Dev server processes. Setup (npm install), port detection, WebView preview. 100KB output buffer. |
| `GitChangesView` | Board-area view (Cmd+Shift+X). File list + diff panel. GitDiffViewModel for batch loading with LRU cache. |
| `DiffView` | NSTableView diff renderer with lazy parsing. Scroll tracking, file navigation, copy support. |

## Board Creation

Three options: existing directory, create new repo (git init), or empty. Agent (Claude/Codex/Gemini) auto-runs on terminal open.

## Card Worktrees

For boards with git repo, each card gets worktree (branch: `card/<uuid>`, location: `../repo-worktrees/`). Terminal starts in worktree. Cleanup prunes stale entries, best-effort branch deletion.

## Terminal Agent Detection

State machine: shell -> agentActive -> agentIdle. OSC 133 D triggers idle, Ctrl+C exits to shell. hasBeenFocused guard prevents false positives.

## Dev Server Preview

Board stores DevServerConfig. First run prompts for commands (auto-detected from package.json). WebView shows in board area. ProcessEnvironment sets BROWSER=none.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Cmd+Shift: N (new board), A (new card), D (delete card), S (dev server), X (git changes). Cmd+W closes file tab.
Shift+Arrow: Up/Down navigates cards/boards, Left/Right moves columns. Enter focuses terminal.
FocusRegion tracks keyboard focus. NSEvent monitor in zenbanApp for app-wide capture.
